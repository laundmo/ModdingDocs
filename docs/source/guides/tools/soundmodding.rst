Sound Modding
==============


Audio Type
-----------

-  You will need to use ``WAV`` format and either ``48000hz`` or ``44100hz`` sample rate.
-  More details below in `creating_your_sound`_

Step 1 - Identifying the Sound
-------------------------------

First you need to identify the exact sound. There's a command for this:
``ns_print_played_sounds 1`` It will show all the audio events that
are happening at that moment on the console.

For example, use your Grapple and open the console the event ID will be
``pilot_grapple_fire``

How it looks in the console: |console|

All weapons, boosts, tacticals have different events IDs on different surfaces (concrete, solidmetal, wood, dirt etc.)
That's why you must identify the exact event/s. Examples based on Grapple:

-  Concrete impact: ``concrete_grapple_impact_1p_vs_3p``
-  Solidmetal impact: ``solidmetal_grapple_extract_1p_vs_3p`` etc.


**NOTE:** ``ns_print_played_sounds 1`` will show you every event ID. Not
just in-match ones. For example:

- The sound when you move the cursor to an option it will be ``menu_focus``, and clicking sound will be ``menu_accept`` or menu music ``mainmenu_music``

Check the console often, as it's easy to miss your sound - there can be a lot of sounds playing.

There's also a `list <https://gist.github.com/begin-theadventure/84c46e803aa358b102d754ff992ae9e4>`_ of all EvenIDs (audio).

Sounds can be played in-game from the console via ``script_ui EmitUISound(soundname)``.

Additionally `subtitles <https://gist.github.com/begin-theadventure/cf941af91cd158de4fde747ec78c2902>`_ in the form of plain text can also be useful.

You can also export sounds with `LegionPlus <https://github.com/r-ex/LegionPlus>`_ instead of playing them in-game.

Open LegionPlus.exe -> Load File -> Titanfall 2/r2/sound pick general.mbnk

If you want to export only a specific sound use search. It's possible to export selected sounds and all (after a search it exports only the found assets).

Step 2 - Creating Folders
--------------------------

When you successfully identified your event and have the audio file/s
ready it's time to set up the folder structure.
Assuming the event name is ``pilot_grapple_fire``, the folder structure of your mod should look like this:

.. code-block:: text
   
   author.mod/
   ├── audio/
   │   ├── pilot_grapple_fire/
   │   │   └── my_audio.wav
   │   └── pilot_grapple_fire.json
   └── mod.json
   

Example of a ``mod.json`` (documented here: :doc:`/guides/gettingstarted`)


.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Name": "MOD_NAME_HERE",
     "Description": "DESCRIPTION_HERE",
     "Version": "0.1.0",
     "LoadPriority": 2
   }


**Inside the ``audio/`` folder:**

-  ``pilot_grapple_fire/`` folder which needs to contain your .wav file(s)
-  ``pilot_grapple_fire.json`` json used to configure the sound override, dont forget to edit.

You will have to add that folder with your sound and the json for each event you want to override.
The event JSON files must contain both ``EventId`` and ``AudioSelectionStrategy`` like this:


.. code-block:: json

   {
       "EventId": [ "pilot_grapple_fire" ],
       "AudioSelectionStrategy": "sequential"
   }

The ``AudioSelectionStrategy`` can be either:

- ``sequential``: If you have one sound or you want to play them in alphabetical order.
- ``random``: If you have more than one sound and you want to randomize them.


.. _creating_your_sound:

Creating Your Sound
--------------------
- **Recommended tool:** `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/download/>`_

Open/Add your audio as a track to Audacity and set the project rate accordingly.
Either ``48000hz`` or ``44100hz`` can work well in most cases, but a few sounds don't use either. Which sampling rate you should use depends on the original sound's sampling rate.

For example: if you use ``44100khz`` and the sound is slightly too high pitched in game, use ``48000khz``. If you use ``48000khz`` and it's slightly low pitched in game, use ``44100khz``.

If you're unsure which to use, or the sound still seems too high, or low pitched, you can use  `LegionPlus <https://github.com/r-ex/LegionPlus>`_ to determine the original rate.

After that, export your track as a 16-bit ``wav`` file (any other bit-depth will cause Northstar to crash).
Make sure you don't add any metadata as this will cause white noise to be at the end of the sound.


.. _issues_with_sounds:

Issues With Sounds
--------------------
- White noise after the sound ends.

This is usually because there's some metadata left in the audio. Remove it to fix this issue.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      You can bulk remove it with `Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html>`_ or individually with Audacity.

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      You can bulk remove it with `Metadata Cleaner <https://metadatacleaner.romainvigier.fr>`_ or a shell script (requires ffmpeg to be installed) and also individually with Audacity.

      ``metadata_remover.sh`` (WAV only)

      .. dropdown:: Script

         .. code-block:: shell

            shopt -s globstar nullglob
            for f in *.wav **/*.wav
            do
            ffmpeg -i "$f" -map 0 -map_metadata -1 -c:v copy -c:a copy "${f%.wav}.new.wav"
            mv -f "${f%.wav}.new.wav" "$f"
            done
            
- Sound is slightly higher/lower pitched in game. This is usually because the sampling rate of your sound doesn't match the original sound's sampling rate. You can use a tool like Audacity to resample your sound to match the original rate. Consult :ref:`_creating_your_sound` for more information.

.. _sound_tools:

Sound Tools
--------------------
- Converters

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      # todo

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      On Linux you can use shell scripts that convert all WAV or MP3 audio files from the current directory (including folders) to WAV 48000Hz 16-bit. They require ffmpeg to be installed.

      MP3 and other formats scripts don't delete previous files, so just search for them (.format) and delete after conversion. WAV script automatically replaces old files.

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: WAV script

            .. code-block:: shell
               
               #WAV to WAV 16-bit 48000 Hz.
               #wav_converter.sh
               
               shopt -s globstar nullglob
               for f in *.wav **/*.wav
               do
               ffmpeg -i "$f" -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48000 "${f%.wav}.new.wav"
               mv -f "${f%.wav}.new.wav" "$f"
               done

         .. tab-item:: MP3 Script

            .. code-block:: shell
               
               #MP3 to WAV 16-bit 48000 Hz.
               #mp3-wav_converter.sh
               
               shopt -s globstar nullglob
               for f in *.mp3
               do
               ffmpeg -i "${f}" -vn -c:a pcm_s16le  -ar 48000 "${f%.*}.wav"
               done

         .. tab-item:: Script for other formats

            .. code-block:: shell
               
               #Replace .format with the one you want to convert.
               #format-wav_converter.sh
               
               shopt -s globstar nullglob
               for f in *.format
               do
               ffmpeg -i "${f}" -vn -c:a pcm_s16le  -ar 48000 "${f%.*}.wav"
               done

Installation
-------------
-  As with any mod, the folder which contains your ``mod.json`` needs to be inside ``Titanfall 2/r2Northstar/Mods/``.
