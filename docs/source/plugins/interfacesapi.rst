Interface API
=============
the plugins system now use source interfaces.

The launcher exposes almost everything required by plugins in interfaces that allow for backwards compatibility.
The only thing that's passed to a plugin directly is the northstar dll HWND and a struct of data that's different for each plugin.

Plugins are required to expose a ``void* CreateInterface(const char* name, int* status)`` function to share their own interfaces.
The launcher loads the ``PluginId`` interface from the plugin to query info such as it's name.

Plugins can use the ``CreateInterface`` function exposed by the northstarDll to use northstar interfaces such as for logging.
An interface is just an abstract class to force all functions into a vftable.

Northstar Interfaces
--------------------

NSSys001
~~~~~~~~

Exposes some system functionality to plugins

.. code-block::

	// 32 bit
	enum LogLevel {
	  INFO,
	  WARN,
	  ERR,
	};

	// handle: handle of the plugin. Passed to the plugin on init.
	void Log(HMODULE handle, LogLevel level, char* msg); // logs a message with the plugin's log name
	void Unload(HMODULE handle); // unloads the plugin
	void Reload(HMODULE handle);

Required Plugin Interfaces
--------------------------

Interfaces that have to be exposed for the plugin to be loaded.

PluginId001
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

	// strings of data about the plugin itself. may be extended in the future
	// 32 bit
	enum PluginString {
	  NAME, // the name of the plugin
	  LOG_NAME, // the name used for logging
	  DEPENDENCY_NAME, // the name used for squirrel dependency constants created. The value returned for this has to be a valid squirrel identifier or the plugin will fail to load
	}

	// bitfields about the plugin
	// 32 bit
	enum PluginField {
	  CONTEXT // 0x1 if the plugin is allowed to run on dedicated servers and 0x2 if the plugin is allowed to run on clients (is this even needed seems useless to me)
	}

	char* GetString(PluginString prop);
	i64 GetField(PluginField prop);

PluginCallbacks001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

	struct PluginNorthstarData { HMODULE handle; };

	// COPY THE initData IT MAY BE MOVED AT RUNTIME
	void Init(HMODULE nsModule, const PluginNorthstarData* initData, bool reloaded); // called after the plugin has been validated. The nsmodule allows northstar plugins to work for the ronin client as well (assuming they update their fork lmao)
	void Finalize(); // called after all plugins have been loaded. Useful for dependencies
	void Unload(); // called just before the plugin is getting unloaded
	void OnSqvmCreated(CSquirrelVM* sqvm); // the context of the sqvm is contained in the instance
	void OnSqvmDestroying(CSquirrelVM* sqvm); // callback with the sqvm instance that's about to be destroyed (for UI, CLIENT is destroyed for some reason??)
	void OnLibraryLoaded(HMODULE module, const char* libraryName); // called for any library loaded by the game (for example engine.dll)
	void RunFrame(); // just runs on every frame of the game I think

What's an interface anyways?
----------------------------

Interfaces are just abstract classes. So make sure the first parameter is always a pointer to the instance of the interface you're using.

an example what NSSys001 looks like in C:

.. code-block::

	typedef enum {
	  LOG_INFO,
	  LOG_WARN,
	  LOG_ERR,
	};

	typedef struct CSys {
	  struct {
	    void (*log)(struct CSys* self, HMODULE handle, LogLevel level, char* msg);
	    void (*unload)(struct CSys* self, HMODULE handle);
	  }* vftable;
	} CSys;

	// use like this
	g_c_sys->vftable->log(g_c_sys, g_handle, LOG_INFO, "my balls are itching");

Interfaces are created with CreateInterface that's exposed in another dll.
