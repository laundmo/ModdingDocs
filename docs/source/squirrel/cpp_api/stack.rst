Stack
=====

Squirrel exchanges values with the virtual machine through a stack.
This mechanism has been inherited from the language Lua.
For instance to call a Squirrel function from native code it is necessary to push the function and the arguments in the stack and then invoke the function;
also when Squirrel calls a native function the parameters will be in the stack as well.

Stack Indexes
-------------

Many API functions can arbitrarily refer to any element in the stack through an index. The stack indexes follow these conventions:

- 1 is the stack base
- Negative indexes are considered an offset from top of the stack. For instance -1 is always the last item pushed to the stack
- 0 is an invalid index

See this example stack for reference:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Stack", "Positive index", "Negative index"

    "p4", "4", "-1"
    "p3", "3", "-2"
    "p2", "2", "-3"
    "p1", "1", "-4"

Stack manipulation
------------------

The Squirrel API offers several functions to push and retrieve data from the Stack.

.. _removefromstack:

.. cpp:function:: __int64 removeFromStack(HSquirrelVM* sqvm)

    .. note::

        This function (``server.dll+0x7000```) is not available in the launcher or plugins at the moment.

        You can open a PR if you need it now.

    :param HSquirrelVM* sqvm: the target vm

    pops the top item of the stack.
