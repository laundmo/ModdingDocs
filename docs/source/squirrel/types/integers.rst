Integers
========

Integers in Squirrel are 32 bit signed integers and can be any whole number (in the 32 bit confines).

An Integer is a primitive type with a default value of ``0``.

The type keyword for Integers is ``int``.

Literals
--------

Integers can be represented with multiple different literals.

- Decimal
  
  Regular decimal letters will always be an integer decimal literal.
  .. code-block::

    int n = 123

- Hexadecimal

  If any number is prefixed with ``0x``, it is a hexadecimal literal.

  .. code-block::

    int n = 0x0012 // 18

- Octal
  
  Numbers starting with a ``0`` are octal literals.

  .. code-block::

    int n = 075 // 61

- Chars

  A single letter or escaped sequence are character literals. Their value is the ASCII value of the letter.

  .. code-block::

    int a = 'a' // 97
    int newline = '\n' // 10
