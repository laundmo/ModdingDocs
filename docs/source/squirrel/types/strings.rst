Strings
=======

Unlike in other languages, strings in squirrel are primitive types and immutable. That means you can't change the value of a string but will need to copy and change it in another variable.

The default value of strings is an empty string with a length of 0.

The type keyword for strings is ``string``.

To create strings, simply write the text of the literals in ``"`` quotes.

.. code-block::
  string s = "this is an example string literal"


Verbatim Strings
----------------

Verbatim strings do not escape sequences. They begin with a ``@`` token before a regular string literal.
Verbatim strings can also extend over multiple lines.
If they do they include any white space between the matching string quotes.

.. code-block::

  string a = "simple string\nover two lines"
  string b = @"simple string
  over two lines"
  
  Assert( a == b )

However, a doubled quotation mark within a verbatim string is replaced by a single quotation mark.

.. code-block::

  string a = "extra quotation mark\""
  string b = @"extra quotation mark """
  
  Assert( a == b )

Assets
------

Assets and strings are internally the same but at compile time they are different types.

Assets are used to reference a specific resource (often in rpak files).

The type keyword for assets is ``asset``.

Asset literals are regular string literals prefixed with the ``$`` token. Verbatim strings can't be an asset.

.. code-block::

  asset a = $"my/resource"

Northstar added the ``StringToAsset`` function that allows converting any string into an asset.
