Var
===

``var`` stands for a variable of any type. Any **primitive** can be ``var``, however complex types can never be ``var``.

.. code-block::

  // var can be just about anything. 
  var v = 1
  v = "string"
  v = []
  v = {}

in ``untyped`` files you can also use the ``local`` keyword instead of ``var``. However the keyword is deprecated and should not be used.

If possible, usage of ``var`` should be avoided and other static types should be used instead to benefit from the type checking of squirrel.
