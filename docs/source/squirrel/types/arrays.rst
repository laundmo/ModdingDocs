Arrays
======

Unlike the data types previously covered, arrays can hold multiple values.

Their size is dynamic and you can add and remove elements at will.

The type keyword is ``array``.

By default, uninitialized arrays are empty.

Arrays are always zero indexed with ``[ <expression> ]``. The indexes are always numbers. If you index an array with a key that does not exist, an error will get thrown.

Literals
--------

Array literals are a comma or newline seperated sequence of expressions delimited by an opening bracket ``[`` and a corresponding closing bracket ``]``.

.. code-block::

  array a = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  array b = [
    1
    2
    3
  ]

Primitive Arrays
----------------

Primitive arrays are arrays that can hold any value. Their content is therefore untyped.

.. code-block::

  array a
  a.append( 1 ) // add a number
  a.append( "str" ) // add a string
  a.append( [] ) // add an empty array

  // because the content type of the array is not defined, all content will be var
  var n = a[0]
  var str = a[1]
  var arr = a[2]

Complex Arrays
--------------

Complex Arrays are arrays that can only hold values that have a specific type.

The content type needs to be specified within ``<`` and ``>`` brackets.

There is no way to define a complex array that holds multiple different types.

.. code-block::

   array<int> a
   a.append( 1 )
   a.append( 0x2 )
   a.append( "3" ) // this will throw a compile error because the array can only contain integers


Static Arrays
-------------

Static arrays are a different kind of complex type. Like complex arrays they can only hold values of one specific type. However unlike complex arrays static arrays have a set length that cannot be changed.

The typing for static arrays is ``type[size]``, where ``type`` is the content type of the array and ``size`` is an **integer literal** of the total size of the array.

Uninitialized static arrays have their size by default and all content values are the **default values of their content type**.

You can index and change content values like with regular arrays.

When initializing a static array you can omit all values after your initial values with ``...``. All following values will get default initialized with the content's default.

.. code-block::

   float[3] v1
   float[8] v2 = [ 1.0, 2.0, ... ]
   v2[2] = 3.0

   print( v1[0] ) // notice how no value needs to be pushed into the vector
   print( v2[7] ) // will print 0.0 because it has been default initialized

Compatability
-------------

It is not possible to cast or convert an array between their different forms. For example you can't assign an ``array<string>`` variable to a different variable that has the type ``array`` or the other way around.

Instead you need to create an entirely new array with the target type or add all contents manually.

.. code-block::

  array<string> orig = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
  array target

  target.clear() // clear all contents from the target array
  foreach( v in orig ) // iterate over the original array and add all contents to the target array
    target.append( v )

Furthermore it's important to understand that ``array`` and ``array<var>`` behave the same but **are not identical**.
