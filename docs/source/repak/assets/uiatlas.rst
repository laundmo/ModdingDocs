UI Image Atlases
================

UI Image Atlases (``uimg``) are what the game uses to store multiple UI assets, they
reference a single texture asset, known as the ``atlas`` and have an array of
``textures`` which defines the different usable UI assets.

Examples:
---------

1. Basic UI Image Atlas with 2 Textures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "$type":"uimg",
        "path":"rui/atlas/example1",
        "atlas":"rui/example1",
        "textures":
        [
            {
                "path":"rui/example1/texture1",
                "width":128,
                "height":128,
                "posX":0,
                "posY":0
            },
            {
                "path":"rui/example1/texture2",
                "width":128,
                "height":128,
                "posX":128,
                "posY":0
            }
        ]
    }

.. note::

    This UI Image Atlas expects a texture with the path of ``rui/example1`` which is at
    least 256x128

Asset Structure:
----------------

``$type``
~~~~~~~~~

For an asset to be a UI Image Atlas asset, the ``$type`` field must be ``"uimg"``.

``path``
~~~~~~~~

The ``path`` field for a UI Image Atlas asset is mostly unused, and as such can be set
to almost any value. It is used when logging information about the asset.

``atlas``
~~~~~~~~~

The ``atlas`` field for a UI Image Atlas asset determines which texture asset it will
use.

.. error::

    If the uimg asset doesn't contain a valid ``atlas`` field, RePak will output one of
    the following errors to the console:

    ``Required field 'atlas' not found for uimg asset '%s'. Exiting...``

    ``'atlas' field is not of required type 'string' for uimg asset '%s'. Exiting...``

    where ``%s`` is the ``path`` field of the UI Image Atlas

.. error::

    If the texture asset cannot be found, RePak will output the following message to the
    console before exiting:

    ``Atlas asset was not found when trying to add uimg asset '%s'. Make sure that the
    txtr is above the uimg in your map file. Exiting..."``

    where ``%s`` is the ``path`` field of the UI Image Atlas

``textures``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``textures`` array in a UI Image Atlas asset defines the different UI textures that
the atlas contains. Any number of UI textures may be contained within one UI Image
Atlas.

``path``
++++++++

An entry in the ``textures`` array must have a ``path`` field, as the game must use it
to identify and show the texture.

.. error::

    If the entry in the ``textures`` array doesn't contain a valid ``path`` field, RePak
    will output one of the following errors to the console:

    ``Required field 'path' not found for a texture in uimg asset '%s'. Exiting...``

    ``'path' field is not of required type 'string' for a texture in uimg asset '%s'.
    Exiting...``

    where ``%s`` is the ``path`` field of the UI Image Atlas

``width`` and ``height``
++++++++++++++++++++++++

An entry in the ``textures`` array must have both a ``width`` and a ``height`` field,
these values should both be integers.

.. error::

    If the entry in the ``textures`` array doesn't contain a valid ``width`` or a valid
    ``height`` field, RePak will output one of the following errors to the console:

    ``Required field 'width' not found for texture '%s' in uimg asset '%s'. Exiting...``

    ``Required field 'height' not found for texture '%s' in uimg asset '%s'.
    Exiting...``

    ``'width' field is not of required type 'number' for texture '%s' in uimg asset
    '%s'. Exiting...``

    ``'height' field is not of required type 'number' for texture '%s' in uimg asset
    '%s'. Exiting...``

    where the first ``%s`` is the ``path`` field of the texture, and the second ``%s``
    is the ``path`` field of the UI Image Atlas

``posX`` and ``posY``
+++++++++++++++++++++

An entry in the ``textures`` array must have both a ``posX`` and a ``posY`` field, these
values should both be integers. These fields determine the location of the top-left
pixel in the UI texture.

.. error::

    If the entry in the ``textures`` array doesn't contain a valid ``posX`` or a valid
    ``posY`` field, RePak will output one of the following errors to the console:

    ``Required field 'posX' not found for texture '%s' in uimg asset '%s'. Exiting...``

    ``Required field 'posY' not found for texture '%s' in uimg asset '%s'. Exiting...``

    ``'posX' field is not of required type 'number' for texture '%s' in uimg asset '%s'.
    Exiting...``

    ``'posY' field is not of required type 'number' for texture '%s' in uimg asset '%s'.
    Exiting...``

    where the first ``%s`` is the ``path`` field of the texture, and the second ``%s``
    is the ``path`` field of the UI Image Atlas
