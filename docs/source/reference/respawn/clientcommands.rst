Client Commands
===============

Client commands are how the clients communicate with the server. Mods can define custom Client Commands that people can then use from the console, or that can be called from a clientside script.

.. cpp:function:: void AddClientCommandCallback(string, void functionref(entity, array<string> ))

    Registers a function as a callback for a client command. This can only be done once per client command string.

    .. code-block::

        AddClientCommandCallback("commandname", commandcallback)

        void CommandCalled(entity player, array<string> args) {
            print("commandname: was kalled with " + args);
        }
