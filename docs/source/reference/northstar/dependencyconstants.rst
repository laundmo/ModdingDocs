Dependency Constants and Compiler Directives
============================================

Compiler Directives
-------------------

Compiler directives are a way to compile code only if a specific condition is met. To
use this you have the ``#if``, ``#endif``, ``#else`` and ``#elseif`` keyword.

Contditons you can check for are
    - ``SERVER`` Checks if the code is compiled on the server VM.
    - ``CLIENT`` Checks if the code is compiled on the client VM.
    - ``UI`` Checks if the code is compiled on the UI VM.
    - ``MP`` Checks if the code is compiled in a multiplayer match.
    - ``SP`` Checks if the code is compiled in a singeplayer match.
    - ``DEV`` Checks if the code is compiled with the ``-dev`` keyword in the startup
      arguments.

These conditions can also be combined with the regular squirrel boolean expressions

.. code-block::

    #if SERVER
    Chat_ServerBroadcast("Message from the server VM")
    #endif

.. code-block::

    #if (CLIENT && MP) || DEV
    ...
    #elseif SP
    ...
    #endif

Dependency Constants
--------------------

Dependency constants are used to only compile code if a dependency your mod requires is
loaded, these use the Compiler directives syntax.

Inside your ``mod.json`` define a constant as:

.. code-block::

    {
        // mod.json stuff
        "Dependencies": {
            // sets the constant to 0 or 1, depending if the mod with the name "Mod Name" exists and is enabled
            "CONSTANT_NAME": "Mod Name"
        }
    }

For Example:

.. code-block::

    "PLAYER_HAS_ROGUELIKE_MOD": "TF|Roguelike"

Will define a constant ``PLAYER_HAS_ROGUELIKE_MOD`` that is set to ``0`` or ``1``
depending if the mod is enabled. It then can be used as a constant/compiler flag.

.. code-block::

    #if PLAYER_HAS_ROGUELIKE_MOD
    print("player has roguelike mod")
    Roguelike_Function();
    #else
    print("Can't use the function because the mod is off :'(")
    #endif
